!!! Ngrok and json server are used in the project, open the project after installing them!!!


# run Ngrok by saying npm run tunnel.
# run the json-server by saying npm run db.

NOTE: JsonServer.replace the baseUrl in the js file with the "Forwarding" extension that comes after Ngrok is run, it is updated at certain periods for security reasons!!!
